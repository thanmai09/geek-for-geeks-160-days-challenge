        "You are given an array prices[] where each number represents the price of a stock on the corresponding day. You may buy and sell the stock multiple times. Find the maximum profit that you can achieve by performing multiple transactions (buying and selling the stock).\n",

        "Note: A stock can only be sold if it has been bought previously and multiple stocks cannot be held on any given day.\n",

        "Buy the stock on day 0 and sell it on day 3 => 310 – 100 = 210.\n",

        "If the price on the next day is higher than the current day, we calculate the profit and add it to the total.\n",
